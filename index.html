  <hr />
  <p>I am currently taking some lessons and courses for software engineering. I find this career to be very interesting and rewarding as well as, very in demand. I started my professional career earlier pursing a degree in Bachelors of
    Science in Nursing. Currently I have a nursing license to practice, but after years of working on computers at my home I quickly realized my passion for software. I decided to continue my education in software engineering and my journey begins
    now!</p>
